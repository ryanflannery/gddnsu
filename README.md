# gddnsu
google dynamic dns update script

## what is it?
gddnsu is a simple script to update your google domains configured for dynamic
dns to your external ip address. it reads a list of domains and credentials
(username and password pairs generated by google domains) from a file,
determines your external ip address, and updates your dns in google domains.

## is this really needed?
for 99% of cases, no. for those cases (updating a single domain) the following
2 line shell script would suffice.

```sh
ip=`curl -s ipinfo.io/ip`
curl -s "https://YourUsername:YourPassword@domains.google.com/nic/update?hostname=YourDomain&myip=${ip}"
```

## so then why this?
if you have an environment where others can drop (sub)domains and have them
configured using various dynamic dns services and want to support google
domains.
