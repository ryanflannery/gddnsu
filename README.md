# gddnsu

A small script to update google domains configured for dynamic dns


## what is it?

gddnsu is a simple script to update your google domains configured for dynamic
dns to your external ip address. It reads a list of domains and credentials
(username and password pairs, generated by google domains) from a file,
determines your external ip address, and updates those domains to your external
ip with google domains.


## is this really needed?

For 99% of cases, where you need to update just a single domain, no.
For those cases, the following two line shell script would suffice:

```sh
ip=`curl -s ipinfo.io/ip`
curl -s "https://YourUsername:YourPassword@domains.google.com/nic/update?hostname=YourDomain&myip=${ip}"
```

where `YourDomain` is registered with
[Google Domains](https://domains.google.com)
and you've configured it for dynamic dns updates, following
[this guide](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083).
After following that guide, google domains will generate `YourUsername`
and `YourPassword` pairs for you (and can regenerate them if you ever feel
they are compromised).


## so then why this?

if you have an environment where others can drop (sub)domains and have them
configured using various dynamic dns services and want to support google
domains.
